# What is lazyParam?
lazyParam is a simple automation tool with implementation of multi-threading created by us [@aniqfakhrul](https://twitter.com/aniqfakhrul), [@h0j3n](https://twitter.com/h0j3n) and [@a_m1rz](https://twitter.com/a_m1rz) for checking hidden parameters in a page. This tool is still in testing phase and more implementations are soon to be made. _note: Works with python3_
